                <p>Nowadays the term Metaverse is quite often misused and misunderstood. By definition, a
                    Metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds that are all focused on social connection.
                    Here at EGOZE, we’re building exactly that.</p>

                <p>We are focused on pushing the boundaries of what people believe is possible in the
                    Web3 space and we're excited to take part in shaping the future.</p>

                <p>The EGOZE Social App, Metaverse, and Play to Earn games are our primary differentiating
                    factors and the core focus of our project.</p>
